# NMRS-POC-OMODS
These sets of modules are required for the full functionality of NMRS POC but the modules are not bundled with the NMRS-POC war file.
The modules should be downloaded and copied to the .OpenMRS/modules folder after a new installation.
Remember to restart the tomcat after copying the modules into the folder for the changes to be effective.

Note that due to the dynamic nature of program reporting requirments and constant system review, these modules are periodically changed.
